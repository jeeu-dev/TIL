* Structuring Machine Learning Projects <br>
>> Training and testing on different distributions
>> Bias and Variance with mismatched data distributions
- train / training-dev / dev / test로 나눔 
- train & training-dev는 같은 분포 / dev랑 test 같은 분포
- More general formulation <br>
    | General speech recognition  |  Rear view mirror speech data  
--- | --- | ---
 Human level                    |  "Human level" 4%  |      
 Error on example trained on    |  "Traing Eror" 7%  |   
 Error on example not trained on|  "Traing-dev error" 10% |  "Dev/Test error" 6%
